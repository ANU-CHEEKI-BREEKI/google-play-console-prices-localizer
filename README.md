Have you ever created ***IAPs*** (In-App Purchases) for your app on Google Play?

Have you thought about ***setting regional prices*** to make purchases more accessible in countries with lower purchasing power?

Doing this ***manually***, even for a single IAP, ***is a nightmare...***

In this repository, there is a program that will help you ***automatically*** update all prices according to your *regional pricing template*.

---

### How to use

One command:

    gps-iap-managing.exe --localize

And all prices will be localized!

**Or you can run the program without parameters. It will display a more detailed help in the console.**


**You also need to set up `../config.json` file**

    {
        "PackageName": "com.MyApp.Package",
        "CredentialsFilePath": "../oauth_client_credentials.json",
        "DefaultPricesFilePath": "../default-prices-in-local-currency.json",
        "SetDefaultPricesPercentage": 0.32
    }


there are example of default-prices-in-local-currency.json

    {
        "crystals_1": { "defaultPrice": 41.22 },
        "crystals_6": { "defaultPrice": 4163.14 },
    }

### How it works

In the file `localized-prices-template.json`, there are multipliers for each country's prices.

    {
        "AE": 0.85,
        "AT": 1.0,
        "AU": 1.0,
        "BD": 0.3,
        "BE": 1.0,
        "BG": 0.6,
        "BH": 0.85
        //...
    }

- The program retrieves a list of all IAPs using the [Google Play Developer APIs](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher), resets their prices to the default price (just like you can do manually in the Google Play Console by clicking on "Update Exchange Rate").
- Then, the program multiplies the local prices by the corresponding multipliers from the `localized-prices-template.json` file.
- After that, the prices are rounded.
- Then, 0.01 is subtracted from the price to make round prices like `10$` become `9.99$`.
- Finally, the program uses the [Google Play Developer APIs](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher) to update the IAPs in your project on the Google Play Console.

The `default prices` remain unchanged! So you can repeat this process as many times as you need.

Google Console does not allow decimal prices for some countries, so the `round-prices-for.json` file contains exceptions. For these countries, the prices will be rounded (no more `9.99`, only `10`).

Currently, the list of exceptions is relatively small:

    ["CI", "CL", "CM", "IL", "JP", "KR", "PY", "SN", "VN"]

### The pain in the ass

To access your project through [Google Play Developer APIs](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher), ***you need to create a desktop OAuth client*** in your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) for your project and ensure that the project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) is ***either live*** or ***you are a tester***.

Then download the **`Client secrets`** of the created OAuth desktop client. This file will be your **`oauth_client_credentials.json`**.

### A couple more commands

`--list [-l]`
    To simply list all IAPs in your project. `-l` To print all local prices, instead of only default prices.

`--restore [-v] [-l]`
    To reset all local prices to the default prices. `-v` To see IAPs lists during restoring, `-l` to also see local prices

`--restore-rev [-v] [-l]`
    To reset all local prices to the default prices provided in default-prices-in-local-currency.json

`--localize-rev [-v] [-l]`
    To reset all local prices to the default prices provided in default-prices-in-local-currency.json multiplied by SetDefaultPricesPercentage
    And set all local prices to  prices provided in default-prices-in-local-currency.json multiplied by % from localized-prices-template.json. 
    This is useful if you want to set regional prices for country that not support local prices yet (Argentina for example). So this countries will show prices based on default price

### Examples

1. You cloned the repository and built the program.
1. You open the command line in the project folder.
1. You downloaded and placed the `client_credentials.json` file with the `client secrets` in the folder next to the project folder.
1. you created and placed the `config.json` file in the folder next to the project folder.
1. you created and placed the `default-prices-in-local-currency.json` file in the folder next to the project folder.
1. The app for which you want to localize prices has the package name `com.MyApp.Package`.

your config.json

    {
        "PackageName": "com.MyApp.Package",
        "CredentialsFilePath": "../client_credentials.json",
        "DefaultPricesFilePath": "../default-prices-in-local-currency.json",
        "SetDefaultPricesPercentage": 0.32
    }

your default-prices-in-local-currency.json

    {
        "crystals_1": { "defaultPrice": 41.22 },
        "crystals_6": { "defaultPrice": 4163.14 },
    }


Then, your commands will likely look like this:

To see the list of all IAPs:

    .\bin\Release\net8.0\gps-iap-managing.exe --list -l

To reset local prices to the default prices:

    .\bin\Release\net8.0\gps-iap-managing.exe --restore

To localize the prices:

    .\bin\Release\net8.0\gps-iap-managing.exe --localize
